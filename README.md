# Tiny Search Engine
## Author: Sasha Ries 
Github username: SashaRies

### Description:
This project is a fully integrated search engine with three main components:

1. **Crawler**: Systematically explores web pages from a seed URL, saving content for later processing.
2. **Indexer**: Creates a searchable index from crawled pages by extracting words and building an inverted index.
3. **Querier**: Processes user search queries, ranks matching documents, and displays results in order of relevance.
